	o To build all programs do

	  make

	  This will first build lib/librzrBTanalyzer.so from the codes in src, then
	  build all the programs in the current directory, linked against the
	  shared library.


	o To run the program, first create a text file (default name=filelist.txt)
	containing a list of the ntuples to be analyzed, one filename per line.
	Then do

	  ./rzrBTanalyzer

	If you wish to specify a different file list, say datafile.list, do

	  ./rzrBTanalyzer datafile.list

	If you wish to change the name of the root output file, say
	datahist.root, do

	   ./rzrBTanalyzer datafile.list datahist.root
